# Chatbot

I wanted to make a chatbot! While it would be cool to pull from OpenAI's api, I wanted to see what I could do without existing apis and such. 

Development Progress:
 - Backend and my dash app is pretty much setup by now
 - A lot of user functionality is setup as well!
 - 

Future Steps:
 - Defininetly look at more complex bot models, maybe use apis like HuggingFace? I've heard it's pretty easy to deploy
